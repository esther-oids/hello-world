# hello-world
Creating my first repository here!

Hello, Git world! I'm from Brazil and I'm slightly new to coding. Well, the truth is that I've been coding on and off for around 5 years now... phew! I'm determined to know more about collaborative coding, as well as any new languages I can pick up. I love p5.js, node.js, python and swift. I would love to learn lua, unity, flutter and react. I'm looking forward to being here! GitHugs from Rio!
